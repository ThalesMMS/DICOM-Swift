// Dequantize — quant-weights → coefficient amplitudes.

// libjxl `dec_modular.cc` and the VarDCT pixel pipeline both walk
// per-coefficient quant *weights* alongside the dequantised
// integer coefficients to recover float DCT amplitudes. This file
// supplies just the multiply layer; the upstream call sites pull
// integer coefficients from the AC entropy stream and per-frame
// `quantizer_scale` from the frame header (we don't model that
// here yet — single-block tests pass a synthetic scale).

// Spec: ISO/IEC 18181-1 §K.7. libjxl: `lib/jxl/dequant_matrices.cc`,
