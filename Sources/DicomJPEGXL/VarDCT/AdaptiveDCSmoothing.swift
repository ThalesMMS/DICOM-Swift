// Adaptive DC smoothing — a 3×3 edge-preserving low-pass applied to
// the dequantised DC plane of a VarDCT frame, between DC-group decode
// and AC-group decode.
//
// Port of libjxl `lib/jxl/compressed_dc.cc::AdaptiveDCSmoothing` /
// `ComputePixel`. The decoder runs this on the full-frame DC plane
// unless the frame header sets `kSkipAdaptiveDCSmoothing` (flag bit
// 7) or `kUseDcFrame` (bit 5). Skipping it leaves a low-frequency
// drift on large textured frames: the DC feeds `LowestFrequenciesFromDC`,
// so an unsmoothed DC shifts every multi-block transform's LLF.
//
// Spec reference: ISO/IEC 18181-1 §K.4 (the DC group). libjxl
// `compressed_dc.cc`.
